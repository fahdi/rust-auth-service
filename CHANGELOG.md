## 📝 Development Notes

### Technical Decisions
- **Rust language choice**: Selected for memory safety, performance, and concurrency
- **Axum framework**: Chosen for async performance and ergonomic API design
- **JWT tokens**: Implemented for stateless authentication with refresh token support

- **Container-first**: Designed with Docker and Kubernetes as primary deployment targets

### Performance Optimizations
- **Zero-copy deserialization** with serde for JSON processing
- **Connection pooling** for database efficiency
- **Multi-level caching** for reduced database load
- **Async/await** throughout for maximum concurrency
- **Memory-efficient data structures** for minimal overhead

### Security Considerations
- **Defense in depth** approach with multiple security layers
