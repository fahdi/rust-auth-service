## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Production Deployment Security

#### Environment Variables (Required)
```bash
# NEVER use default values in production
export JWT_SECRET="your-256-bit-cryptographically-secure-random-key"
export DATABASE_URL="mongodb://username:password@host:port/database"

# Use strong database credentials
export DB_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

#### Configuration Security
```yaml
# config.yml - Never hardcode secrets
auth:
  jwt:
    secret: "${JWT_SECRET}"  # Use environment variable
    expiration_days: 1       # Short expiration for security
  bcrypt:
    rounds: 12               # Strong password hashing

rate_limit:
  enabled: true
  requests_per_minute: 60   # Prevent brute force
  
logging:
  level: "warn"             # Don't log sensitive data in production
```

#### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS only** in production
- **Configure proper CORS** origins
- **Enable rate limiting**
- **Use strong database authentication**
- **Isolate services** with firewall rules

#### Monitoring & Alerting
```bash
# Monitor for security events
grep "auth_failure" /var/log/rust-auth-service.log

# Set up alerts for:
# - Multiple failed login attempts
# - Unusual access patterns
# - Database connection failures
# - High error rates
```

### Development Security

#### Secure Development Environment
```bash
# Use SSL even in development
./scripts/generate-ssl.sh

# Regular security audits
cargo audit

# Keep dependencies updated
cargo update
```

#### Testing Security
```bash
# Run security tests
cargo test security

# Load testing for DoS resistance
artillery run load-test.yml

# Input validation testing
curl -X POST localhost:8090/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"../../../etc/passwd","password":"test"}'
```

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment-based configuration** (no hardcoded secrets)
- **Secure headers** (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- **CORS protection** with configurable origins

auth_requests_total{status="failed"}
auth_rate_limit_exceeded_total
account_lockouts_total

# System metrics
http_requests_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"}
database_connections_active
memory_usage_bytes

# Security events
security_events_total{event_type="brute_force"}
failed_logins_total{reason="invalid_credentials"}
```

#### Log Events to Alert On
- Multiple failed login attempts from same IP

## üîí Conclusion

Security is a shared responsibility. By following these guidelines and maintaining open communication about security issues, we can ensure the Rust Auth Service remains secure for all users.

**Remember**: When in doubt about security, err on the side of caution and report the issue. We'd rather investigate a false positive than miss a real vulnerability.

Thank you for helping keep the Rust Auth Service secure! üõ°Ô∏è
