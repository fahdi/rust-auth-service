## Milestone 3: Production Deployment & Operations Progress

### ✅ COMPLETED: Kubernetes Deployment Infrastructure

**Commit:** `b235ffe` - feat: implement comprehensive Kubernetes deployment and Helm charts

**Components Implemented:**

1. **Complete Kubernetes Manifests** (`k8s/` directory):
   - `namespace.yaml` - Namespace with resource quotas and limits
   - `configmap.yaml` - Application config and nginx configuration
   - `secrets.yaml` - Secret management with external secret operator support
   - `deployment.yaml` - Production-ready deployments with security hardening
   - `statefulset.yaml` - MongoDB and Redis with persistence
   - `service.yaml` - Services with ClusterIP and LoadBalancer
   - `ingress.yaml` - SSL termination and rate limiting
   - `rbac.yaml` - Service accounts and pod security policies

2. **Comprehensive Helm Charts** (`helm/auth-service/` directory):
   - `Chart.yaml` - Helm chart metadata
   - `values.yaml` - Comprehensive configuration options
   - `templates/` - Production-ready Kubernetes templates with:
     - Flexible deployment configuration
     - Auto-scaling support (HPA)
     - Pod disruption budgets
     - Security contexts and resource limits
     - Service monitoring integration

**Key Features:**
- Non-root container execution with read-only filesystem
- Pod anti-affinity for distributed deployment
- Rolling updates with zero-downtime strategy
- Resource requests/limits for optimal scheduling
- Health checks with proper timeouts and retry logic

### ✅ COMPLETED: Production Monitoring Stack

**Currently Working On:** Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting

**Components Implemented:**

1. **Prometheus Configuration** (`monitoring/prometheus/`):
   - `prometheus.yml` - Complete scrape configuration for all services
   - `rules/auth-service.yml` - Comprehensive alerting rules covering:
     - High error rates (warning >5%, critical >10%)
     - Response time alerts (P95 >1s)
     - Service availability monitoring
     - Resource usage alerts (memory >512MB, CPU >80%)
     - Security events (failed logins, rate limiting)
     - Business metrics (registration rates, password resets)

2. **Grafana Dashboards** (`monitoring/grafana/`):
   - `auth-service-dashboard.json` - Comprehensive dashboard with:
     - Real-time request rate and error rate monitoring
     - Response time distribution (P50, P95, P99)
     - Database and cache performance metrics
     - Authentication events tracking
     - System resource monitoring
     - Security events visualization

3. **Alertmanager Configuration** (`monitoring/alertmanager/`):
   - `alertmanager.yml` - Multi-channel alerting with:
     - Email notifications for different severity levels
     - Slack integration for real-time alerts
     - PagerDuty integration for critical alerts
     - Inhibition rules to prevent alert flooding

4. **Log Aggregation** (`monitoring/loki/` and `monitoring/promtail/`):
   - Loki configuration for centralized log storage
   - Promtail configuration for log collection from:
     - Auth service application logs
     - Docker container logs
     - System logs (syslog)
     - Nginx access and error logs
     - Authentication audit logs

5. **External Monitoring** (`monitoring/blackbox/`):
   - Blackbox exporter for external health checks
   - HTTP/HTTPS endpoint monitoring
   - SSL certificate validation
   - DNS resolution monitoring

6. **Complete Monitoring Stack** (`monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml`):
   - Orchestrated deployment of entire monitoring infrastructure
   - Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Loki, Promtail, Jaeger
   - Node, Redis, MongoDB, Nginx exporters
   - Distributed tracing with Jaeger

## Next Steps (In Progress)

### Currently Working On:
1. **Production Configuration Management** - Environment-specific config handling
2. **Health Monitoring Systems** - Advanced health check automation  
3. **Backup and Disaster Recovery** - Automated backup procedures

### After Milestone 3 Completion:
- **Milestone 4: Advanced Authentication Features**
- **Milestone 5: API Enhancement & Documentation**  
- **Milestone 6: Performance & Scalability Optimization**
- **Milestone 7: Developer Experience & Tooling**

## Technical Highlights

### Production-Ready Features Implemented:
- **Security:** Non-root containers, RBAC, pod security policies, secret management
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling (HPA), load balancing, anti-affinity rules
- **Observability:** Metrics, logs, traces, alerting, dashboards
- **Reliability:** Health checks, rolling updates, pod disruption budgets
- **Operations:** Helm charts, external secret management, monitoring stack

### Performance Optimizations:
- Resource limits and requests for optimal scheduling
- Pod anti-affinity for distributed deployment
- Readiness and liveness probes with proper timing
- Rolling update strategy for zero-downtime deployments
